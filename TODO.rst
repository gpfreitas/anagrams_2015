- Add support for multiple versions of Python.
- Add git hooks for requiring that tests pass before committing.
- Consider again if there is any benefit in adding logging support. I think
  this is so simple (and with so few opportunities to debug even via print
  statements) that it's not really necessary.
- Go over the codebase again and see if any clarification comments are in
  order.
