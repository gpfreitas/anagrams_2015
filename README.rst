Anagrams
========

A string is a sequence of characters. A string ``x`` is an anagram of string
``y`` if and only if the characters of ``x`` are a permutation of the
characters of ``y``.

The script ``anagrams.py`` allows the user to extract anagrams of a given input
word from a file containing one word per line.

The script ``test_anagrams.py`` contains tests for the script ``anagrams.py``.

For more information, read the documentation at the beggining of ``anagrams.py``.
